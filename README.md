# Personal Website Home

[See the result](https://dubillaudb.fr)

## Home web page
All pages are in a different GIT repo to keep a clear architecture.

## Goal
As an IT student in engineering school, I aimed to create my own website to expose my resume and my projects.
It is a simple Home Page, so I didn't look for something difficult to code, but for something easy to use and cool.

## What i used
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/intro-whatis.php) to build the asked page and choosing language.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for buttons and some animations, but, the page isn't responsive for design reasons (but works well on any display i tested (smartphone / display 16:9, 4:3 / tablet).
* [ParticlesJS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for design.

## How to test it
As the page is build with differents PHP file, you may need an apache server. Otherwise, I let index.html file so you can try the design without any local server. index.html is only in repo and in local, but not on my server, which use index.php and built the page in the asked language (EN / FR).

### Do whatever you want with it
